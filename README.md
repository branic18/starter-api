# Starter API

The purpose of this starter API is to ask the user a short set of questions to determine their current overall digital privacy knowledge. This helps the user be aware of and bust digital protection myths.

## This Starter API is a supportive feature of the Privacy Audit Tool!

A tool that evaluates the privacy settings of users’ social media accounts to compose a digestible visual report that provides recommendations to improve their online privacy practice and empower their digital safety. A special feature is using two-factor authentication to keep their accounts secure on the privacy audit tool.

Features:
- Social Media Privacy Dashboard: Summary of overall social media privacy health (includes alerts) and notifies the user of how to improve their social media privacy by analyzing metrics such as name, aliases, phone numbers, emails, location data, device data, etc. (but mostly whatever information is available through the Instagram API)
- Privacy Settings and Guidelines Manager: Focuses specifically on the user’s privacy settings. Let's the user know the impacts of their current privacy settings as well as any updated terms and conditions that would affect the privacy settings of any of the user's accounts
